    <li><p>The <b>societal objective</b> of CITIES is to establish a realistic and concrete pathway to ultimately achieving independence from fossil fuels by harnessing the latent flexibility of the energy system through intelligence, integration, and planning, focusing on city environments and working towards both 2020 and 2050 European and Danish goals.</p></li>

    <li><p>The <b>scientific objective</b> of CITIES is to develop methodologies and ICT solutions for the analysis, operation and development of fully integrated urban energy systems. A holistic research approach will be developed that aims to provide solutions at all levels between the appliance and the total system, and at all time scales between operations and planning.</p></li>

    <li><p>The <b>educational objective</b> of CITIES is to educate a generation of academics, engineers and entrepreneurs on the value sand necessity of considering the energy system as a whole in a collaborative, integrated context, rather than focusing on a single facet or component.</p></li>

    <li><p>The <b>commercial perspective</b> of CITIES is to identify and establish solutions which can form the background for commercial opportunities within the smart cities environment, and to support the development of these  and other smart cities demonstration projects, including through a range of decision support tools to be developed as a result of our research efforts.</p></li>
